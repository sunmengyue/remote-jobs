Clear processes and realistic planning avoids fires!\n* Paid Meetups: We love remote, but face to face is pretty great too. Come meet with your colleagues in Barcelona or at a local meetup.\n* Competitive rates, long-term outlook: We offer competitive rates and a long-term, full-time contract position.

      "description": "bit.io is building the fastest way to get a database, query data, and share data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 publicly or privately. Despite the assertion that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdata has become the new oil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the tooling around databases has not meaningfully changed in twenty years. Even with the push for big data and machine learning, a frustrated, growing cadre of data scientists and engineers have to spend too much time setting up and maintaining a basic set up just to use data. bit.io allows users to become immediately productive with data, reducing time from data upload to query to 1 minute. And, our users love it, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour product is amazing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009creally love your product, maybe the best on the market\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sold on bit.io\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nbit.io\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long term vision is to become the place for all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data, private and public, just like github is the place for source code. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a team of passionate dataphiles to make that vision a reality and make data - especially public data - more accessible to everyone. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a ton of thorny database, infrastructure, UI, and UX problems to solve along the way. Come build it with us.\nCritical toward achieving bit.io\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision is a datastore that (1) scales to petabyte queries while still enabling fast query-iteration by users, and (2) applies data best practices while remaining flexible when opinionated defaults aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. You will build bit.io\u00e2\u0080\u0099s datastore.\n##As a Software Engineer at bit.io you will:\n* Work across the stack on all aspects of software engineering for the core product\n* Collaborate directly with all teammates on a small, productive technology team\n* Solve petabyte-scale problems in the data space\n* Design, build, test and deploy a complex data management system\n* Make broad, impactful technology decisions with responsibility for their outcomes\n##We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone who has:\n* Shipped product\n* Experience and passion in data, data engineering, and data processing\n* Deep knowledge in data management - parsing, cleaning, querying, extracting, etc.\n* A strong drive to make software easy-to-use\n##The ideal backend engineering candidate will have:\n* Expertise in Python and SQL\n* Constructed APIs with technology like REST, OpenAPI, or gRPC\n* Developed with microservices and container technologies like Docker & Kubernetes\n* High proficiency in building data processing pipelines, working with structured data, and leveraging common database technologies\nbit.io is an early-stage, well-funded startup that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fully remote. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re outcome-oriented, scientific, curious, respectful, resilient, and inclusive. In addition to competitive salary, equity, bonus, and benefits (including top-tier insurance, generous new-parent leave, and unlimited PTO), we do two unique things: (1) in order to be inclusive and to counter systemic hiring inequities, salary and equity is transparent and not negotiated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 every employee with the same role and level is paid exactly the same; and, (2) we have 4-day x 8-hour work weeks (i.e., no Fridays) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we value work-life balance and think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just as productive.

      "description": "You'll form a key part of a team of developers building React-based components and applications to support our SaaS eCommerce and headless platforms.\n\nAs an example of what you'll be working on: we're building **headless eCommerce sites with Gatsby** and rich **interactive product customisers with Next.js on Vercel**.\n\nYou start your day in a team Stand Up discussing progress you made yesterday, listening to your team members describe their current issues and dropping some knowledge bombs on how you \u00e2\u0080\u009csolved this last time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working from home today, so you pay the pet tax and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.\n\nFirst up you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a pair-programming session with a Junior Developer in your team to help them through a tough search component that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been steadily improving under your experienced wing and are turning into a really productive team member.\n\nAfter lunch you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set your Slack status and turn on Do Not Disturb for a couple of hours while you debug a weird issue with a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s site. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a change to the out of stock logic recently to support multiple warehouses. You update your unit test suite to cover this unexpected scenario and tell the Project Manager the good news! You push your feature branch to Bitbucket and watch Bitbucket Pipelines build your artifact and prove that your tests pass.\n\nYour JIRA issue has automatically transitioned to \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Code Review\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you open your pull request, studying your diff carefully before assigning it to your team mate for a sanity check.\n\nTomorrow (assuming all is well!) you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll merge your pull request into a release branch and let Pipelines deploy it to Staging where it will be regression tested by the QA Team and their bank of automated tests. It should be out to Production by the end of the week, providing we can get through the testing and get client sign off by 2pm on Thursday.\n\n**If you read this and it sounds like your ideal job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we want you on the team!**\n\n### What you'll be doing\n\nThe following should give you an idea of how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to typically be spending your time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not set in stone and it may change from week-to-week, but it gives an idea of what is expected from the role.\n\n#### Software Development (80%)\n\nThe majority of your time will be spent working with your team to deliver software that meets the needs of our customers. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t time that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spend entirely in your editor, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stand up, sprint planning, scoping, architecting and designing that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take part in to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building exactly what we need in the right way.\n\nGiven your experience, a portion of this time is expected to be spent assisting other team members in delivering their work effectively.\n\n#### Process and Tooling Improvements (10%)\n\nMaking sure that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit still and keep evolving the way we build and deliver software is a critical investment of time, particularly from a team member with your experience. Use this time to try that tool you read about and see if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy of being a part of our toolchain.\n\n#### Personal Development (10%)\n\nKeeping up with new software releases, development practices, horror stories and post mortems are an essential part of any Software Developer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time! Use this time to push forward your objectives and research tools and techniques you need to stay productive.\n",

      "description": "**Promising drone-delivery startup is hiring a Dataset and Machine Learning Manager to work remotely. OneSec is working on a groundbreaking GPT-scale machine learning project to make autonomous delivery drones. In this job, you will build the Datasets and Neural Networks that fly our autonomous delivery drones. These drones will then deliver millions of meals and other packages in the real world.**\n\n##About OneSecondDelivery\nWe are creating a food delivery app that uses autonomous drones to deliver the food. We deliver everything 5 times faster and 100 times cheaper, thanks to small autonomous delivery-robots. The company was founded in 2017 by a leading expert on drone legislation and a successful e-commerce entrepreneur. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vice Presidency of Innovation has recognized the large potential of this project and has supported us with the XGrant Prize and other resources.\n\nYou can check out our website OneSec.com for more info\n\n##Job Description\nOneSec is building one of the largest machine learning projects in the drone industry.\nWith our own photorealistic flight simulator, and a fleet of prototype drones, we are building one of the largest depth perception datasets in the world, with 60 million training samples. As well as an unsupervised pre-training pipeline with 400 million training samples. We are building a large computer cluster of NVIDIA and Tenstorrent chips to scale up our machine learning project to this scale. \n\n####Your job has 3 components:\n* Neural network training and optimization\n* Dataset management and generation\n* Supporting our hardware team in building up our exaflop-scale machine learning cluster\n\n####Here are some of the Neural Networks you will be building:\n\n-Delivery surface finder:\nA neural net that picks the optimal delivery surface within a balcony or backyard of a customer.\nUsually this will be a table or chair or a section of the floor that has enough clearance.\n\n-OneSec Fruxel Depthmap:\nThis is a convolutional neural network that takes camera images and generates a 3D representation of the space around the drone. Our pathplanner then uses this depthmap to plan a collision free path for the drone. This neural network represents the core of our autopilot system. \n\n-Delivery Clearance Model:\nThis model checks the camera images to see if the scene is safe to approach. We don't fly into a balcony if there's a human or dog in it. And when we approach a restaurant to pickup a package, we make sure the scene is clear of humans, pets etc.\n\n###Requirements\n* The most important thing is that you are excited about this project, and like the mission of our company.\n*  Knowledgeable about machine learning and neural networks. Both practical and theoretical.\n* Experience with computer vision and convolutional networks\n* Experience with PyTorch and TensorFlow\n* Good computer skills, and general tech savvy: you will do many tasks like setting up recording devices to record datasets, creating small python programs for dataset labelling and management, post processing large image datasets etc.\n\n###Benefits:\n* Take part in a huge success story\n* Flexible work schedule\n* Competitive cash compensation\n* Equity compensation (become a partner in the company)",

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also involved in government-backed initiatives to address skills gaps such as The Institute of Coding and the National Centre for Computing Education.\n\nApplications\n\nPlease use our online form by pressing 'Apply for this job' below, including your CV and a cover letter telling us why you'd like to come work with us.\n\n\nSoftware Engineer interview process\n\nWe do an initial competency interview which consists of some screening questions, like checking your right to work in the UK (unfortunately we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sponsor visas), and your experience in our hiring competencies.\n\nThis first interview has two purposes: it's a chance for you to ask questions about how we work, and for us to find out what you're looking for from your next role.\n\nWe'll also be interested to find out more about your curiosity, initiative, technical, communication and teamwork skills. So we'll be interested to talk about things like: your approach to dealing with difficult situations like dealing with conflicting or ambiguous requirements, how you communicate your work with others and how you learn new things and teach others.\n\nThe final stage interview consists of a pairing session with one of our engineers. You'll also get the opportunity to meet a couple of people from the Product org to ask any further questions.\n\nHow we assess candidates\n\nWe use a set of competencies to evaluate candidates throughout the interview process: communication, initiative, teamwork, curiosity and technical skill. You can read more about these in our blog post about our hiring framework.\n\nRecruitment Process\n\nPlease contact jobs@futurelearn.com if you require any reasonable adjustments or alterations to be made, to support you through the recruitment process.\n\nDiversity Statement\n\nWe value all the great benefits that diversity brings and encourage everyone to bring their whole self at work, regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability.\n\n\nCOVID19\n\nWe encourage freelancers and people who have been made redundant as a result of COVID-19 to apply for opportunities at FutureLearn. We believe that in these difficult times, good employers have to rise to the occasion and play their part in the community. At FutureLearn, we take care of each other.\n",

      "description": "### TL;DR: why should you apply\n\nSocial mission, flexible work schedule, supportive team, real opportunity to make impact.\n\n### The company\nPatients Know Best is developing a personal health records service that is changing the way people manage their health, making their life easier and opening up a global market in the process. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built a platform to help patients and clinicians share medical data online that is being used in the UK and abroad.\nWe are a fully distributed team, everyone is working remotely. The core values of our team:\n* we are here to make people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives better: everyone at PKB is here to make a positive impact in the world\n* full transparency: all information is made available to everyone (unless there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really good reason not to)\n* flexibility, trust and outcome-focus: we care about the results of your work, not how and when you achieve it\n* support: everyone is encouraged to ask questions and help each other\n* continuous improvement on all levels: we iterate on software, but we also iterate on * infrastructure, organisation, culture so that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a better company every year that builds a better product every year\n### Our stack\nPKB services are hosted on Google Cloud Platform.\n* Infrastructure is managed with Terraform.\n* Our JVM-based back-end services are deployed to Kubernetes clusters\n* Data is stored in Postgres (both GCP-managed and self-hosted), Cloud Storage, BigQuery, etc.\n* Monitoring is done with Prometheus and Grafana\n* Business intelligence & reporting is based on BigQuery, G Data Studio, G Pub/Sub\n### About the role\nThis is a high-impact role that comes with lots autonomy and requires a self-driven, collaborative person.\nYou will be the first person who is fully focused on cloud infrastructure. You will be designing the cloud architecture, deployment pipeline and development environment. You will be able to build your own team as the company grows if you need further people.\nThe role requires broad skills: you should be able to\n* analyse the current state of the platform\n* prioritise work to achieve the best return on the development resources we invest\n* participate and lead implementation efforts\n* identify the proper metrics and measures to track the stability and performance of of the system\n* collaborate with other development teams to help them achieve their goals and improve their efficiency\nA few specific examples:\n* Better CI/CD: we have tons of tests -- it would take almost a day to run all of them on a common laptop. This is great for QA, less great for development experience.\n* Zero trust/BeyondCorp-like company infrastructure: designing a scalable, robust path forward to secure and deploy our internal tooling\n* Improving the monitoring of JVMs, clusters, applications\n* Architect the optimal storage setup for multi-terabyte relational and key-value data.\n### Requirements\nYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily have to be proficient in all of these, but the more you know the better.\n* outstanding written communication skills and good verbal communication skills\n* experience with remote work\n* hands-on experience with CI/CD, e.g. testing and deploying dependent microservices\n* knowledge of Kubernetes, Terraform, e.g. managing secrets, resources, networks\n* Google Cloud Platform\n* JVM ecosystem, e.g. profiling, monitoring, tuning\n* networking\n* databases, e.g. various replication methods, monitoring, PITR recovery\n* coding/automation experience: our primary need is automation, not administration\n### Benefits\nSupportive and smart colleagues, flexible work, opportunity to make a big societal impact, 25 days holiday, competitive salary.",

      "description": "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com.\n\nAhum. Here it comes.\n\n\n## What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Silverfin?\n\nAt Silverfin we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\n\nThe good news is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still plenty left to work on, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we hope you come in.\n\n## What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Team Syncs?\n\nOne of the core features of Silverfin is integration with the bookkeeping software that accountants already work with, in order to import their accounting data. This means we have API integrations with over 30 different vendors, and we want to add many more as we expand to different markets.\n\nTeam Syncs is the team responsible for creating and maintaining those integrations. The ideal candidate loves working with APIs, including the uncertainty they bring. Some APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or unreliable, and it can be challenging to build a reliable integration. Yet the satisfaction of empowering our customers to import gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software and enabling the advanced features Silverfin makes it all worth it.\n\nAs a member of Team Syncs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work on solving scaling issues, building and maintaining API clients, and improving transparency and communication on the status of the the sync process to the users.\n\n\n## What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly how it should be.\n\nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever reason, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\n\nBeing remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a written, persisted record. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DnD function, especially when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not working!\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\n\n\n## What does working at Silverfin look like?\n\nWe work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.\n\nOur ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cother side\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nOur stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.\n\nWe have a UI-kit to make front-end development easy and consistent, but at Team Syncs there will be little to no front-end development necessary.\n\nNo code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.\n\nSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.\n\n*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that hard to achieve if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?\n\n\n## What does your future look like?\n\nPersonal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.\n\nEveryone has a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get paid like any normal day.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to hire a lot of new colleagues, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to have a couple of more teams in the future. Each new team would also need a new teamlead, and we prefer to promote from within the engineering team. This means if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to step onto the management track, there will be plenty of opportunities to do so in the near future. We pro-actively keep track of who would be interested, and provide feedback and learning opportunities to work towards such a goal.\n\n\n## What are we looking for?\n\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails\u00e2\u0080\u0099 training wheels if necessary.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.\n* You enjoy integrating with APIs and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easily dissuaded when encountering unreliable or poorly documented systems.\n* You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.\n* You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.\n* You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.\n* You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\n\n## What can we offer you?\n\n* Actual, proper work-life balance\n* A salary range of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac60.000 - \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100.000 a year\n* Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely\n* Personal growth training and opportunities\n* Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries\n* A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\n* A \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills\n\n## Requirements\n\n* You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.\n* You get Rails\n* Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)\n\n## Nice to have\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\nThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry if none of the following applies to you.\n\n* Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team\n* Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring\n* Experience in Fintech\n* Accounting knowledge\n\n## Interested?\n\n* [Read about what our interviewing process looks like](https://engineering.silverfin.com/engineering-interview-process/)\n* [Apply for the job right here](https://grnh.se/6bc90f722us)\n* Or email us with any questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com",

      "description": "(Fully remote, 75%+ overlap with UK working hours, non-UK applicants within EMEA are welcome)\n\nDebugBear is looking for an experienced JavaScript developer with significant back-end development experience.\n\n**What we do**\n\nDebugBear helps companies make their websites better by continuously monitoring site speed and quality metrics. Many of our customers are developers themselves and value the in-depth reporting we provide.\n\nYou will be working directly with the technical founder and have a significant impact on all aspects of the product.\n\n**The role**\n\nAs a full-stack developer you will:\n\n- Implement and maintain product features while keeping in mind user experience, implementation costs, and maintainability\n- Make the product scale to a large number of users\n- Ensure the product is secure\n- Take on other tasks as required (e.g. customer support or doing research for a technical blog post)\n\nWorking in an early-stage company, you need to be able to take on a variety of tasks and complete them successfully, sometimes in the absence of established processes. You need to be mindful of customer needs to understand and challenge requirements and solutions.\n\n**Working at DebugBear**\n\nWe value building a stable product that doesn't break unexpectedly, especially not outside work hours. That means working with proven technologies where possible, writing automated tests, and monitoring the service.\n\nWhile there is some flexibility with work hours, this is not an asynchronous role. Frequent communication is expected.\n\nCollaboration is mostly through Slack and GitHub, but this might change in the future as needed.\n\n**Tech stack**\n\nHere are some of the technologies we use:\n\n- TypeScript\n- Express\n- Postgres\n- Google Cloud\n- Jest, Puppeteer\n- React, Sass CSS, Storybook\n\n**Application process**\n\n- Introductory call discussing the role and your experience\n- Technical interview\n- 2h development assignment\n- Assignment review call\n\n\n**Have questions?**\n\nEmail matt@debugbear.com if you have questions about the role.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nYou will need at least 6 years of commercial development experience, including significant experience with:\n\n- Node\n- JavaScript\n- HTML/CSS\n- Relational databases (e.g. Postgres/MySQL)\n- Cloud Computing (e.g. AWS/GCP/...)\n- Automated Testing/CI\n\n**Bonus points**\n\nWe also value experience with the following:\n\n- TypeScript\n- React\n- Web performance optimization\n- Building SaaS products\n- Building developer tools\n- Working for a small business\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- 30 days paid days off\n- Fully remote\n- Flexible work hours\n- Laptop provided\n\nThe total budget for this role is $90,000 - $115,000 per year. This is what you would get if working as a contractor. In the UK this would translate to a salary of \u00c2\u00a350,000 - \u00c2\u00a365,000 ($69,000 to $90,000).",
