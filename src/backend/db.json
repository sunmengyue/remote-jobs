      "description": "You'll form a key part of a team of developers building React-based components and applications to support our SaaS eCommerce and headless platforms.\n\nAs an example of what you'll be working on: we're building **headless eCommerce sites with Gatsby** and rich **interactive product customisers with Next.js on Vercel**.\n\nYou start your day in a team Stand Up discussing progress you made yesterday, listening to your team members describe their current issues and dropping some knowledge bombs on how you \u00e2\u0080\u009csolved this last time\u00e2\u0080\u009d. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working from home today, so you pay the pet tax and encourage your four-legged-friend wave to the camera before logging off.\n\nFirst up you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a pair-programming session with a Junior Developer in your team to help them through a tough search component that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been steadily improving under your experienced wing and are turning into a really productive team member.\n\nAfter lunch you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set your Slack status and turn on Do Not Disturb for a couple of hours while you debug a weird issue with a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s site. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a change to the out of stock logic recently to support multiple warehouses. You update your unit test suite to cover this unexpected scenario and tell the Project Manager the good news! You push your feature branch to Bitbucket and watch Bitbucket Pipelines build your artifact and prove that your tests pass.\n\nYour JIRA issue has automatically transitioned to \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Code Review\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you open your pull request, studying your diff carefully before assigning it to your team mate for a sanity check.\n\nTomorrow (assuming all is well!) you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll merge your pull request into a release branch and let Pipelines deploy it to Staging where it will be regression tested by the QA Team and their bank of automated tests. It should be out to Production by the end of the week, providing we can get through the testing and get client sign off by 2pm on Thursday.\n\n**If you read this and it sounds like your ideal job \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we want you on the team!**\n\n### What you'll be doing\n\nThe following should give you an idea of how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to typically be spending your time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not set in stone and it may change from week-to-week, but it gives an idea of what is expected from the role.\n\n#### Software Development (80%)\n\nThe majority of your time will be spent working with your team to deliver software that meets the needs of our customers. This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t time that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll spend entirely in your editor, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stand up, sprint planning, scoping, architecting and designing that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take part in to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building exactly what we need in the right way.\n\nGiven your experience, a portion of this time is expected to be spent assisting other team members in delivering their work effectively.\n\n#### Process and Tooling Improvements (10%)\n\nMaking sure that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit still and keep evolving the way we build and deliver software is a critical investment of time, particularly from a team member with your experience. Use this time to try that tool you read about and see if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthy of being a part of our toolchain.\n\n#### Personal Development (10%)\n\nKeeping up with new software releases, development practices, horror stories and post mortems are an essential part of any Software Developer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time! Use this time to push forward your objectives and research tools and techniques you need to stay productive.\n",

      "description": "**Promising drone-delivery startup is hiring a Dataset and Machine Learning Manager to work remotely. OneSec is working on a groundbreaking GPT-scale machine learning project to make autonomous delivery drones. In this job, you will build the Datasets and Neural Networks that fly our autonomous delivery drones. These drones will then deliver millions of meals and other packages in the real world.**\n\n##About OneSecondDelivery\nWe are creating a food delivery app that uses autonomous drones to deliver the food. We deliver everything 5 times faster and 100 times cheaper, thanks to small autonomous delivery-robots. The company was founded in 2017 by a leading expert on drone legislation and a successful e-commerce entrepreneur. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vice Presidency of Innovation has recognized the large potential of this project and has supported us with the XGrant Prize and other resources.\n\n##Job Description\nOneSec is building one of the largest machine learning projects in the drone industry.\nWith our own photorealistic flight simulator, and a fleet of prototype drones, we have built one of the largest 3d perception dataset in the world, and we are building a large computer cluster of NVIDIA and Tenstorrent chips to scale up our machine learning to GPT-Scale.\n\n####Your job has 3 components:\n* Neural network training and optimization\n* Dataset management and generation\n* Supporting our hardware team in building up our exaflop-scale machine learning cluster\n\n####Here are some of the Neural Networks you will be building:\n\n-Delivery surface finder:\nA neural net that picks the optimal delivery surface within a balcony or backyard of a customer.\nUsually this will be a table or chair or a section of the floor that has enough clearance.\n\n-OneSec Fruxel Depthmap:\nThis is a convolutional neural network that takes camera images and generates a simple, but highly sophisticated vector representation of the space around the drone. Our pathplanner then uses this depthmap to plan a collision free path for the drone.\n\n-Visual Odometry Model:\nOur control system always needs an accurate understanding of how our drone is moving around from frame to frame.\n\n-Payload Positon tracker:\nWhile delivering the package, our control system needs to know how the package is sliding out of the payload bay. This model simply takes in the camera images and outputs the current location of the package.\n\n-Delivery Clearance Model:\nThis model checks the camera images to see if the scene is safe to approach. We don't fly into a balcony if there's a human or dog in it. And when we approach a restaurant to pickup a package, we make sure the scene is clear of humans, pets etc.\n\n\n###Requirements\n* The most important thing is that you are excited about this project, and like the mission of our company.\n* Highly knowledgeable about machine learning and neural networks. Both practical and theoretical.\n* Experience with computer vision and convolutional networks\n* Experience with PyTorch and TensorFlow\n* Good computer skills, and general tech savvy: you will do many tasks like setting up recording devices to record datasets, creating small python programs for dataset labelling and management, post processing large image datasets etc.\n* Computer programming experience in other areas is helpful",

      "description": "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com.\n\nAhum. Here it comes.\n\n\n## What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Silverfin?\n\nAt Silverfin we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\n\nThe good news is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still plenty left to work on, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we hope you come in.\n\n## What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Team Syncs?\n\nOne of the core features of Silverfin is integration with the bookkeeping software that accountants already work with, in order to import their accounting data. This means we have API integrations with over 30 different vendors, and we want to add many more as we expand to different markets.\n\nTeam Syncs is the team responsible for creating and maintaining those integrations. The ideal candidate loves working with APIs, including the uncertainty they bring. Some APIs we need to use are poorly designed, badly documented or unreliable, and it can be challenging to build a reliable integration. Yet the satisfaction of empowering our customers to import gigabytes of data from their clunky bookkeeping software and enabling the advanced features Silverfin makes it all worth it.\n\nAs a member of Team Syncs you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work on solving scaling issues, building and maintaining API clients, and improving transparency and communication on the status of the the sync process to the users.\n\n\n## What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly how it should be.\n\nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever reason, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\n\nBeing remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a written, persisted record. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DnD function, especially when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not working!\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\n\n\n## What does working at Silverfin look like?\n\nWe work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.\n\nOur ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cother side\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nOur stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.\n\nWe have a UI-kit to make front-end development easy and consistent, but at Team Syncs there will be little to no front-end development necessary.\n\nNo code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.\n\nSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.\n\n*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that hard to achieve if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?\n\n\n## What does your future look like?\n\nPersonal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.\n\nEveryone has a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get paid like any normal day.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to hire a lot of new colleagues, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to have a couple of more teams in the future. Each new team would also need a new teamlead, and we prefer to promote from within the engineering team. This means if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to step onto the management track, there will be plenty of opportunities to do so in the near future. We pro-actively keep track of who would be interested, and provide feedback and learning opportunities to work towards such a goal.\n\n\n## What are we looking for?\n\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails\u00e2\u0080\u0099 training wheels if necessary.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.\n* You enjoy integrating with APIs and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easily dissuaded when encountering unreliable or poorly documented systems.\n* You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.\n* You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.\n* You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.\n* You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\n\n## What can we offer you?\n\n* Actual, proper work-life balance\n* A salary range of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac60.000 - \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100.000 a year\n* Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely\n* Personal growth training and opportunities\n* Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries\n* A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\n* A \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills\n\n## Requirements\n\n* You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.\n* You get Rails\n* Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)\n\n## Nice to have\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\nThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry if none of the following applies to you.\n\n* Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team\n* Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring\n* Experience in Fintech\n* Accounting knowledge\n\n## Interested?\n\n* [Read about what our interviewing process looks like](https://engineering.silverfin.com/engineering-interview-process/)\n* [Apply for the job right here](https://grnh.se/6bc90f722us)\n* Or email us with any questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com",

      "description": "(Fully remote, 75%+ overlap with UK working hours, non-UK applicants within EMEA are welcome)\n\nDebugBear is looking for an experienced JavaScript developer with significant back-end development experience.\n\n**What we do**\n\nDebugBear helps companies make their websites better by continuously monitoring site speed and quality metrics. Many of our customers are developers themselves and value the in-depth reporting we provide.\n\nYou will be working directly with the technical founder and have a significant impact on all aspects of the product.\n\n**The role**\n\nAs a full-stack developer you will:\n\n- Implement and maintain product features while keeping in mind user experience, implementation costs, and maintainability\n- Make the product scale to a large number of users\n- Ensure the product is secure\n- Take on other tasks as required (e.g. customer support or doing research for a technical blog post)\n\nWorking in an early-stage company, you need to be able to take on a variety of tasks and complete them successfully, sometimes in the absence of established processes. You need to be mindful of customer needs to understand and challenge requirements and solutions.\n\n**Working at DebugBear**\n\nWe value building a stable product that doesn't break unexpectedly, especially not outside work hours. That means working with proven technologies where possible, writing automated tests, and monitoring the service.\n\nWhile there is some flexibility with work hours, this is not an asynchronous role. Frequent communication is expected.\n\nCollaboration is mostly through Slack and GitHub, but this might change in the future as needed.\n\n**Tech stack**\n\nHere are some of the technologies we use:\n\n- TypeScript\n- Express\n- Postgres\n- Google Cloud\n- Jest, Puppeteer\n- React, Sass CSS, Storybook\n\n**Application process**\n\n- Introductory call discussing the role and your experience\n- Technical interview\n- 2h development assignment\n- Assignment review call\n\n\n**Have questions?**\n\nEmail matt@debugbear.com if you have questions about the role.\n\n**Requirements**\n\nYou will need at least 6 years of commercial development experience, including significant experience with:\n\n- Node\n- JavaScript\n- HTML/CSS\n- Relational databases (e.g. Postgres/MySQL)\n- Cloud Computing (e.g. AWS/GCP/...)\n- Automated Testing/CI\n\n**Bonus points**\n\nWe also value experience with the following:\n\n- TypeScript\n- React\n- Web performance optimization\n- Building SaaS products\n- Building developer tools\n- Working for a small business\n\n**Benefits**\n\n- 30 days paid days off\n- Fully remote\n- Flexible work hours\n- Laptop provided\n\nThe total budget for this role is $90,000 - $115,000 per year. This is what you would get if working as a contractor. In the UK this would translate to a salary of \u00c2\u00a350,000 - \u00c2\u00a365,000 ($69,000 to $90,000).",

      "description": "At [Tettra](https://tettra.com), we make software that helps hundreds of teams share knowledge to grow and thrive together. Our product is primarily used by teams to answer repetitive questions in chat and onboard new hires faster. We use our own product every day to help our own team operate too.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a small, 100% remote company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing our customer base and team quickly. We believe in optimizing for the long-term, which means we operate at a sustainable pace and are financially sustainable.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting our first-ever sales team. This is a unique opportunity to have direct input into the sales process and learn how a small software company operates directly from the founders.\n\nSalary range is between $90,000 - $120,000 USD\n\n**This is a full-time, remote position based in the US.**\n\n# About the role\n* As one of our first Account Executives, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the opportunity to help us iterate on our founder-led sales process. We want you to bring your experience and ideas to help us improve our processes and close rate. \n* Own the entire customer lifecycle from lead to close - Perform demos, presentations, and trainings for prospects and customers to help ensure proper understanding and adoption of Tettra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s product\n* Effectively manage your pipeline of leads and opportunities so that you can consistently drive revenue for Tettra and strong ROI for our customers.\n* Consistent attainment of quota and revenue goals in a high-volume, consultative sales role.\n* Take rigorous notes on calls with prospects to share with other internal teams and reference yourself\n* Develop ad-hoc sales collateral to help educate prospects on the value of Tettra\n* You will be working most directly with our two co-founders: [Andy Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andygcook/) and [Nelson Joyce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnelsonj/)\n* In the future, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help train and onboard future sales hires\n\n# About you\n* 1-2+ years in a sales role (AE/AM/BDR/SDR/Product Specialist) at a SaaS company\n* You have experience tracking all your sales activities in a CRM. Experience with HubSpot CRM is a plus.\n* You are in sales because you love talking to customers and helping them find solutions to their questions and problems.\n* When you have an idea to improve a process or workflow, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but try it out and iterate on your experiment. You love to share your learnings with others to help them improve too.\n* You are naturally curious and have a history of learning new skills or finding an answer through self research. This is especially important in a remote company because you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always have someone to ask in the moment for an answer.\n* You excel at self management and can keep yourself organized, productive, and motivated to hit your goals.\n* Strong written and verbal English skills.\n\n# Benefits\n**Competitive salary** - Our goal is to hire the best people and compensate them fairly. Our salaries are based on Boston-area rates and we pay the same no matter where you live in the US. We have internally transparent salary bands for each role and update them at least once a year. We also provide equity.\n\n**Work from wherever** - We are a results-driven remote team and operate mostly asynchronously. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care where you are or what timezone you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re based in, as long as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the US.\n\n**Flexible vacation** - Take time off when you need it. All you need to do is just give the team some notice ahead of time. We recommend 3-4 weeks in addition to public holidays, but there are no firm rules. We trust you to take the time you need to be productive.\n\n**Health, dental, and vision insurance** - We cover 100% of you and your family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insurance, including dependents, on our PPO Blue Cross Blue Shield and Principal policies.\n\n**Paid parental leave, including adoption** - 12 weeks of paid leave for all new parents.\n\n**New-hire success package** - We will buy you a new Mac laptop or equivalent of your choice, and provide you a $750 stipend to spend on whatever you want to improve your work-from-home setup (e.g. a big monitor, a standing desk, high-quality webcam)\n\n**Co-working stipend** - We will cover up to $250 USD per month if you want to work from a co-working space.\n\n**Personal development** - Up to $500 per year reimbursement to spend on learning to improve your knowledge and craft through our Free Books & Courses program.\n\n**Transparency** - We believe that access to information is key to making the best decisions. Therefore, everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know our revenue, goals, growth rates, and cash on hand so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprises.\n\n# Why work with us?\n**We are remote** - We are a remote company and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an office. We believe in trust and autonomy. Our internal operating system is geared towards asynchronous communication, common goals, and evaluations based on results. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked remotely before as long as you can ask good questions, collaborate mostly over written communication with others, and hold yourself accountable to get your work done.\n\n**We are a calm company** - We believe in work/life harmony. Our team works a solid 40-hours per week, then we sign off in the evenings and on weekends to do what we enjoy outside of work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like spending time with friends & family, self improvement, or interesting hobbies. We scope our work to only the most important tasks and get those done by not wasting time on pointless status meetings, brainstorming discussions, or projects that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually important. We can do all this because we are funded by revenue from actual customers and therefore don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the pressure to sprint to become a $1B company (or bust.)\n\n**We use our own product every day** - We use our own product to share knowledge and document our processes internally. \n\n**We strive to be fair** - We work hard to make sure our hiring practices and compensation systems are fair and inclusive to people of all backgrounds.\n\n**Everyone has a voice** - We believe that good ideas can come from anywhere. We hire smart, ambitious people like you because we want to hear your thoughts.\n\n**We are using our leverage for good** - We currently donate 1% of all revenue to help fight climate change through [Stripe Climate](https://stripe.com/climate). We also offer discounted Tettra accounts to qualifying nonprofits to help their teams work more effectively to do more good in the world.\n\nAt Tettra, we believe that diverse teams result in better products and experiences for our customers and are more interesting to work on too. We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. ",

      "description": "Note: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently looking for candidates in any timezone! Regardless of where you are, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be happy to see you apply, especially if you feel you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a great fit. This is a remote, full-time position.\n\nHey! \n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ElevenYellow.\n\nWe believe in a different way of work and play. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a startup studio that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launched dozens of SaaS products. Our website is a terminal. Our Slack is pretty dysfunctional. But we make it work with a lot of emojis pinned messages, and Google Sheets.\n\nLong story short, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fully-remote working family and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting better at what we do.\n\nIf this resonates with you at all, please keep reading.\n\n**Who we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for:\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a senior front-end developer that knows how to develop cleanly and concisely. Specifically, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for somebody to ship fast with the rest of our team on highly commercialized apps used by thousands of users. \n\n**Proficiencies:\n\n- HTML, CSS, JS\n- React.js + Node.js\n- Meteor.js is a bonus\n- Next.js is a bonus\n- LESS, SASS or SCSS is a bonus\n- UX / UI advanced understanding\n- Basic competency in Web3\n- You take comfort in working independently / you take pride in your work\n\nBasically - if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a front end developer that likes making things look beautiful, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear from you.\n\n**We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serious about\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n- Markup\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re serious about mark-up, the structure that lies underneath what websites look like. Well-thought structure can do a lot of good to a website and is helpful for things like responsive web design, findability in search engines, accessibility and maintainability.\n\n- Design\n\nWe take pride in our projects. While we launch a lot of projects, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to do this at speed and in style. Projects we deem successful require a solid design that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a boring template.\n\n- Speed\n\nHopefully you like moving QUICKLY. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend weeks mocking up things in Sketch. Our developers are quick and talented, meaning we get projects out in the open super fast. This means new features need to be beautified and our new web apps need a bit of a visual restructure.\n\n**We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not trying to convince you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but we have our perks\n\n- Work remotely \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very experienced in working remotely. We were digital nomads before digital nomads were a thing. Feel free to pick up your laptop and work wherever you want, whenever you want. Just make sure you have a good internet connection and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good :)\n- Take vacay\nWe know what it feels like to work \u00e2\u0080\u009ctoo much\u00e2\u0080\u009d and our way of work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meant to be stressful. Time off is the remedy to a lot of things, and we encourage you to take time off work. Three weeks is the minimum.\n- Annual Retreats\nWe do yearly, week-long retreats and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love it if you joined us (we pay your way, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to meet each other in person and we value time spent with one another (whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on Slack or face-to-face). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met up all over Europe and islands across South East Asia. Naturally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait for COVID to die down this time around, but that should be just around the corner (we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re optimists)!\n- We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a laid back bunch\nWhile team retreats sound awesome (and they are), our company ethos is what we value the most. Life is all about enjoyment, and work should be too. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all laid back and understand the human side of work and play.\n\n**Oh and these things too\n\n- Competitive Salary (remuneration depends on experience)\n- Health Insurance Coverage (monthly, set budget)\n- Self Improvement Budget (monthly, set budget)\n- Gym Membership (Monthly, set budget)\n\nWe believe applications should be human and conversational. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d mostly appreciate it if you told us who you were and what you wanted to do in life, both personally and professionally. \n\nOf course, please only disclose what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable with. And not to forget! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an equal opportunity employer and we encourage everyone to apply. We respect genders, ethnicities, boundaries, friendships, and the human aspect of work.\n\n",

      "description": "We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our HR Department in the role of Recruiter. Training will commence in early January and run approximately 4-6 weeks.\n\nWhile the HR team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps -- the choice is yours.\n\nThis is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down.\n\nIn order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before.\n\n**What is a Recruiter?**\n\nThe EF Recruiter works directly with HR and individual team supervisors to carry out annual hiring goals for each department.\n\nResponsibilities include undertaking all hiring activities from advertising open roles, and interviewing candidates to closing hires.\n\nUltimately, the person in this role will be responsible for consistently sourcing qualified people while maintaining a positive candidate experience as brand representative of Empire Flippers.\n\n**What's the Opportunity?**\n\nBecoming a Recruiter makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers.\n\nYou will represent our brand and promote Empire Flipper's company reputation as a great place to work to all candidates and interested applicants while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world.\n\nYour work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least 2 years experience in the full recruitment life cycle and also have various recruiting methods in your arsenal. If you're a strong communicator and comfortable forming hiring strategies, we'd like to meet you.\n\n**What's the Recruiter Position Like?**\n\nWhile we are an Inc. 5000 company, we're not overly corporate. You'll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a solid candidate onboard.\n\nIt has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us.\n\nWhen you first come aboard as a Recruiter, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.\n\nYou will become well versed in all of our pre-employment processes, from how our job postings are created and posted to our career page to methods we use for sourcing candidates.\n\nOnce you have the basics down, you will network online and offline with potential candidates to promote our employer brand, reduce our time-to-hire and ensure we attract the best professionals. Ultimately, you will build a strong talent pipeline and help hire and retain skilled team members for our positions.\n\nYou might be wondering, though ... what your daily work routine really look like once you're up and going?\n\nHere is a list of daily tasks we'll expect from you (though this isn't an exhaustive list and could change):\n\n-   Create appealing job descriptions and publish job ads in various portals\n-   Source potential candidates on niche platforms\n-   Promote EF's mission, culture and reputation as a great place to work\n-   Ensure our Career Page remains optimized\n-   Craft and send personalized recruiting emails with current job openings to passive candidates\n-   Interview candidates combining various methods (e.g. structured interviews, technical assessments, presentations, and behavioral questions)\n-   Assess candidates to ensure qualification match, cultural fit and compatibility\n-   Support hiring teams and help them make objective hiring decisions\n-   Track hiring metrics\u00c2\u00a0\n-   Select and maintain an Applicant Tracking System\u00c2\u00a0\n-   Build relationships with candidates for the future\n-   Carry out background and reference checks\n\nUltimately, you'll help our company grow and thrive by hiring the most qualified people.\n\n**What Skills Are Needed?**\n\nWe believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.\n\n**You must have experience**. We are looking for a skilled recruiter with 2+ years of full-cycle recruitment experience who has strong interpersonal skills and can speak to our candidate base by selling the EF culture and career opportunity. We're requiring hands-on experience with large job sites like Monster and Indeed.\n\n**Sales chops**. The person in this role must have a sales mentality. If you've got recruiting experience you understand the churn; preparing the job, starting the search, phone screening, video interviewing, and recruiting top candidates by selling the job, the culture, and the company with enthusiasm!\n\n**You're a confident and proactive self starter**. You will face obstacles and challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 You need to be able to pick up the phone and call a top tier candidate who isn't sure if they should accept the role. Perhaps they have another job offer, or are being asked to stay on at their current company.\u00c2\u00a0 It will be up to you to sell the benefits of working for Empire Flippers to make sure those reservations are met head-on and solved.\n\n**Technical experience.** To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and Candidate Management Systems (CMS).\n\n**You're excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand**. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.\n\n**What's the Lifestyle Like?**\n\nOur company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You'll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.\n\nWe aren't going to chain you to a cubicle. While we're an Inc. 5000 company, we're not a Fortune 500 company. You won't be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight.\n\nWe are going to rely on your experience to make our recruitment process better and smoother for our candidates. Because of our fast growth in each department, we will need good, trained \"hands on deck\" candidates to handle that growth.\n\nWhen you first start off, you will be training with our HR manager and other team supervisors for 4-6 weeks. We typically meet in-person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.\n\nSpeaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building -- we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD).\u00c2\u00a0 So dust off your passport, and we'll aim to see you then!\n\n**Love it. What's the Catch?**\n\nWe love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.\n\nA big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.\n\nSometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you're in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have candidates in every corner of the globe.\n\nSometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn't every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer an applicant's series of questions, so you'll need to be prepared for that.\n\nA lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.\n\nWe focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry.\n\nWe're made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this recruiter position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.\n\nThe annual salary for this position is $75,000 -- $80,000 USD. We also offer paid, international healthcare coverage and equity stake in the business.",

      "description": "Piktochart is hiring a Frontend Tech Lead to help shape the future of business storytelling in the Innovation team. Besides having technical expertise and knowledge in the Frontend domain, you are someone who is keen on mentoring (note, not managing) a team, as well as ensuring their execution and quality towards achieving the goals.\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have the freedom, trust, and autonomy to do your best work. The Front end team currently consists of 10 developers, split between Innovation, Growth and the Piktostory team (another product line). You will be reporting directly to the CTO.\n\n**Your mission **\n \n1. Strong craft\nCraft includes not just delivering the most bug-free (current and future) code on the planet, but also value that is well-thought of. We implement features on a continuum of progressive enhancements and the Front end team supports this by writing automated tests, clean, maintainable, and efficient code.\n \n2. Problem-solving is your thing\nWe value developers that are user-focused and problem-solvers. To do that, a developer has to be curious and inquisitive about the users and the business. For example, you build a proof-of-concept of fonts and color schemes to enable teams to be on brand, while also recommending the best font and color pairing. We believe that developers and designers should work together, so the developers should actively research and think of good ways to implement a solution.\n \n3. Collaborative work makes the outcome better\nYou thrive in a collaborative atmosphere, working together with product designers and PM, Customer Support, and Marketing on the tasks that need to be done. You actively participate and contribute to discussions around making our product better.\n \n4. Coach the team to constantly give their best and improve\nThe team regularly gets together to discuss code reviews and best practices. You are expected to be able to contribute to those discussions and help lead and coach the teams. While we do not expect any form of performance review, you have to enjoy working with other Front end developers and help them hone their craft.\n\n**What You Offer **\n\nYou have led or mentored front-end developer teams in startups with a similar profile to us (SAAS, remote a plus) and bring an extensive share of strategic learnings & experiences. You have shown how you maintained a strong craft and intend to continue on that path. \n\nThis position is remote, and the candidate has to be in either Asia or Europe.",
