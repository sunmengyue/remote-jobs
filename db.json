      "description": "Nathan James is looking for an experienced Lead Software Engineer to help drive one of our teams in the development and support of our in-house ERP system that's tailored to meet the needs of our rapidly growing eCommerce business. The product spans inventory, warehouse management, purchasing, and more. You will play a key role in guiding the implementation and growth of the team and product leading to improving our control and tracking of every aspect of the business as well as help increase productivity and reduce costs for the company. We are looking for someone to help dive in and solve some interesting problems that exist between the digital and physical world via our API first ERP.\n\n\nPeople-first company, design-first home.\n\nWe are a design-first, home furnishing company focusing on the habits of urban dwellers and first time home buyers. We pride ourselves on the best in class customer happiness, providing the highest possible quality products that are affordable for the majority and assembly that isn't dreadful.\n\nBecause we are a people-first company, we understood the importance of being fully distributed from the beginning. We strive to reduce friction at work while preserving the human experience. Taking this approach helps our teammates avoid compromising who they are or their values in pursuit of a career.  \n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\nThis role will be part of a continually growing engineering department solving real world issues and be a key player in bringing to life new functionality for the system.\n\nAs a Group Lead you will collaborate with the team to review requirements, build out functionality, squash bugs, and expand automated testing. During on-boarding, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly. Once fully up-to-speed (2-3 months), the initial focus will be on or related to Purchase and Sales Orders, Inventory Management, Warehouse Management, and Accounting. The team will help with direction and design decisions, trade-off and risk recommendations, and general experience improvements.\n\nYour work will be leveraged by Nathan James to move away from 3rd party systems, improve existing workflows, enhance business processes, and reduce costs.\n\n\nABOUT US:\nWe understand, now more than ever, that time is finite. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why with everything we work toward, we try to solve for happiness. Happiness means a lot of different things to different people, so we put in the work that goes into building an inclusive and supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. Our values and our benefits are designed to support a healthy relationship with your work. Our operating values provide the framework we use in building a happy and resilient organization.\n\nWe also understand working for Nathan James isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the main function of your life, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect that! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that a team member who will be happy and fulfilled as a remote team member at Nathan James is someone who values their personal life and identity outside of work. \n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create mandatory team hangouts or events. We focus on how to improve collaboration, not forcing engagement.\n\nWe collaborate best when we listen and learn from each other. We become stronger when we advocate new perspectives and viewpoints. This gives us all the chance to amplify our voices to achieve our goals. We focus on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re solving for, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create barriers or expectations that distract us from our mission. We also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set unreasonable working hours, deadlines, or goals. We create with calm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cslow is smooth and smooth is fast\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  \n\nWhen you join the Nathan James team, you can expect a thorough, but mindful onboarding process with ramp-up time to learn. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect minimal meetings. You can expect to work with smart and good people. You can expect to be counted on. Most importantly, you can expect to do the best work of your career here. \n\n\nABOUT YOU:\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for someone who is an open and active communicator, with a strong team mentality, and is actively curious. You have experience with API-first products, deploying features often and well tested, passionate about automation, and comfortable knowing when you need help or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know something.\n\nYou love complex challenges, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driven by problem solving and not just duct tape solutions. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to do something you use existing documentation and your resourcefulness to dive-deep and figure it out. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require constant hand-holding, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not afraid to speak up when requirements aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear or they require additional context and details.\n\nYou have 6+ years of experience working in a LAMP/LEMP stack with Laravel and REST APIs. Additionally, experience with queues (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc), Vue, and/or DevOps is an added plus. You have at least 3+ years developing and deploying consumer or enterprise applications at scale. At a minimum, you must have deep interest and knowledge of the eCommerce landscape.\n\nYou have experience leading a team, balancing thoughtful leadership and mentorship to both provide answers when needed and allow your teammates to grow. You also know when to push back to ensure the team is not overwhelmed. \n\nThis is a remote role, since we are a remote company. With the freedom and flexibility of a remote role comes the luxury to work in whichever manner helps you perform your best!

      "description": "# Role\nWe are looking for a passionate 3D Engineer that is up to speed in the areas of 3D modeling (data generation, validation, storage, querying), and 3D visualization (real-time rendering of large CAD models and Point Clouds) to contribute to the models & 3D parts of the Bimsync application, designing all solutions for scalability and performance.\n\nThe 3D models in the construction industry are ever growing in size and complexity and this requires robust solutions and a pragmatic mindset to find solutions that fit our patterns for today and tomorrow. Having previous experience from software for the construction is a plus (not mandatory).\n\nYou are expected to have good structural thinking, math skills, a good understanding of database technologies as well as being able to break-down complex problems into smaller parts that can be delivered to production independently in a timeboxed fashion.\n\nYou will be working as part of a small and highly effective 100% remote team, taking part in major technical decisions, defining technical requirements, scoping and helping to create and upgrade features around one of the core areas of our Bimsync application with the team. \n\n# What we are looking for\n\nYou should have a very good understanding of backend technologies combined with the 3D information for handling the geometry of the models. We expect a strong intimacy and proficiency in application of 3D, geometric algebra, algorithms, and data structures. Familiarity with our tech stack for the viewer is a plus: TypeScript, three.js, WebGL, shaders coding with GLSL.\n\nGeneral knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each particular use case. We use a combination of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and DocumentDB for our data storage. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs.\n\nOur backend is written mostly in Java, with the performance critical parts currently in C++ (we are open to evaluate other language options for new features). \n\nWe believe in a growing and learning mindset, where people will be up to face a new challenge and learn a new technology when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is important, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a prerequisite.\n\nWe define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company's working language is English, so we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken).\n\nThis position is open for fully remote, but has a requirement of being located in the EU.\n# What we offer\nYou will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations, and develop as we learn.\n\nIn addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth. Some of our benefits:\n\n* Paid time off (25 vacation days per year)\n* Flexible working hours\n* Full remote possible\n* Share options program\n* Company gatherings twice a year (in person)\n\n# Catenda\nCatenda is a Norwegian scale-up company with a global ambition to make the construction industry data-driven, with less waste and greater transparency along the way.\n\nOur company values are two, easy to remember: **Openness** and **Quality**.\n\nWe believe in open standards for all our customer data to achieve interoperability between applications, from inception, through design and construction onto the maintenance of a building.

      "description": "# Role\nThe main responsibility for this position is to produce high quality code and shape together with the team the best practices vertically across the solution, including the frontend application, using React-Redux with TypeScript and the backend APIs. Also an important part of the job is to interact with our designer to create pixel perfect UIs according to design specs.\n\nIn this role you will be working as part of a small and highly effective cross functional team, where most developers have a full stack understanding of the technical challenges.\n\nAs a main developer in the team, you will be part of all major technical decisions, shaping the best practices and creating new features for our product Bimsync by deploying code to production regularly.\n\n# What we are looking for\n\nWe are looking for a passionate Full Stack Engineer that wants to own and help shape our web application for the construction industry. You should have a good understanding of web and backend technologies and the different challenges of creating web applications backed by REST APIs that are cloud native, having previously developed applications in the public cloud (AWS preferably).\n\nWe expect a strong intimacy with JavaScript, as our application runs mainly in React, Redux and Typescript, and Java, as most of our backend stack is written in this language. We also look for proficient knowledge of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, to tune and shape the best data structures for each particular use case. Another important point is having familiarity with REST APIs and a good understanding of backwards compatibility for public APIs. \n\nThe list above is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect you to be familiar with our whole tech stack coming in. That said, you need to have a willingness to learn as you go, as we believe in a growing and learning mindset, where developers are ready to face new challenges, and learn new technologies when needed. Thus, having the right skills and a positive attitude to learning, is more important for us than the degree. A BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related subject is relevant, as we value an understanding of the fundamentals, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a prerequisite.\n\nWe define ourselves as an agile company, so being open for feedback and adapting to change is core to being a good fit to our team. Our company's working language is English, in which we expect all candidates to effectively communicate (written and spoken).\n\nThis position is open for fully remote, but has a requirement of being located in the EU.\n\n# What we offer\nYou will be part of an amazing journey to transform the construction industry with a bold and caring team. Along this path, we will challenge each other, have difficult open conversations, and develop as we learn.\n\nIn addition to the above, we will also take care of you and provide you with the right challenges for growth. Some of our benefits:\n\n* Paid time off (25 vacation days per year)\n* Flexible working hours\n* Full remote possible\n* Share options program\n* Company gatherings twice a year (in person)\n\n# Catenda\nCatenda is a Norwegian scale-up company with a global ambition to make the construction industry data-driven, with less waste and greater transparency along the way.\n\nOur company values are two, easy to remember: **Openness** and **Quality**.\n\nWe believe in open standards for all our customer data to achieve interoperability between applications, from inception, through design and construction onto the maintenance of a building. Another core belief is that our customers should have full control over their data: all data that goes in, can also be exported out.\n\nWe value quality of the code and the product by working as a tight and effective distributed development team, preferably asynchronously, often sharing screens to collaborate.

      "description": "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com.\n\n*Ahum. Here it comes.*\n\n### What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Silverfin?\n\nAt Silverfin we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.\n\nThe good news is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still plenty left to work on, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we hope you come in.\n\n### What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly how it should be.\n\nWorking with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whatever reason, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.\n\nBeing remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a written, persisted record. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DnD function, especially when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not working!\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be really happy to welcome you in our #engineering channel, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.\n\n### What does working at Silverfin look like?\n\nWe work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people. [Find here more information about our engineering teams.](https://engineering.silverfin.com/engineering-teams/)\u00c2\u00a0\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be supported by our UI designer who develops and maintains HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-framework, and even builds Vue.js prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive as well.\n\nOur ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cother side\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nOur stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.\n\nNo code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.\n\nSoftware for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB * , and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.\n\n*: Our ops team noted that this actually isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that hard to achieve if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?\n\n### What does your future look like?\n\nPersonal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to move to management in order to advance. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.\n\nEveryone has a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get paid like any normal day.\n\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to hire a lot of new colleagues, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to have a couple of more teams in the future. Each new team would also need a new teamlead, and we prefer to promote from within the engineering team. This means if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to step onto the management track, there will be plenty of opportunities to do so in the near future. We pro-actively keep track of who would be interested, and provide feedback and learning opportunities to work towards such a goal.\n\n### What are we looking for?\n\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails\u00e2\u0080\u0099 training wheels if necessary.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.\n* You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.\n* You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.\n* You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.\n* You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.\n\n### What can we offer you?\n\n* Actual, proper work-life balance\n* A salary range of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac60.000 - \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100.000 a year\n* Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely\n* Personal growth training and opportunities\n* Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries\n* A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues\n* A \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming language.\n* You get Rails\n* Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)\n\n### Nice to have\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n\nThese would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry if none of the following applies to you.\n* Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team\n* Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring\n* Experience in Fintech\n* Accounting knowledge\n\n### Interested?\n\n* [Read about what our interviewing process looks like](https://engineering.silverfin.com/engineering-interview-process/)\n* [Apply for the job right here](https://grnh.se/e21a38802us)\n* Or email us with any questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com",

      "description": "<ul><br /><li>Full-time permanent role</li><br /><li>Based remotely, from your home</li><br /><li>Simple hiring process: 3 interviews + code exercise</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Write code day-to-day and upskill those around you</strong></p><br /><p>Do you enjoy coaching others and working with colleagues who help each other develop their skills every day? We partner with our clients to deliver projects and new product features every day, whilst helping to develop the skills, knowledge and capability of those around us in the team. You'll have the opportunity to work in Product Development teams in different domains, both greenfield products as well as evolving existing ones.</p><br /><p>Why are we looking for polyglot developers? Well, we know everyone has their favourite language or framework, but we also know that it&rsquo;s important to use the right tool/language/framework for the job at hand, and that a pragmatic approach might mean using a language that is already in production. Also, polyglot developers tend to focus on core software engineering principles and practices, rather than what is shiny in a new framework or language. So whilst we usually work with JavaScript it doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t able to transfer our engineering skills and work with other languages when it makes sense.</p><br /><p>Through regular Learning Lunches, Technical Brown Bags, Software Crafters Meetups, Start of Week meetings, Team Offsites and other social and community events, our team learns and collaborates together and is always sharing knowledge and helping each other, both within Pragmateam, clients and the community.</p><br /><p>To be successful in this role you must have an open mind to sometimes work with a language that is not your usual one and most likely consider yourself a polyglot, ie. someone who is happy to learn new languages or further develop their skills if needed for the task at hand. You must also love developing the skills of other software engineers and helping them improve their craft and capability. The ability and passion to coach others and make things a little bit better is part of the job, so having the empathy and soft skills to do it is important.</p><br /><p><strong>Why it's good&hellip;</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Opportunity to work across a variety of domains, with different problem spaces and technologies.</li><br /><li>Able to share your knowledge and develop the skills of those around you, whilst writing code and learning every day.</li><br /><li>Be a member of a cross-functional agile team delivering together end-to-end.</li><br /><li>Working in a stable product team (ie. we don't like pure project work) provides a lot of job satisfaction as you are an integral part of the product development process.</li><br /><li>We work in clients employing continuous delivery practices such as CI, automated testing and continuous deployment.</li><br /><li>We prefer to work for medium or small product companies instead of large enterprises, as it's easier to be set up for success, have a positive impact and influence.</li><br /><li>We choose our work and often say no, so people like the work that we do around here.</li><br /><li>Education &amp; Work From Home budget that you manage yourself: decide if you want to go to a conference, spend it all on books or dedicate yourself to an online training course, all while having a professional, productive and comfortable setup for when you're WFH</li><br /><li>The 'team' in 'Pragmateam' does mean something: we are never by ourselves in clients so that we can support each other and deliver together.</li><br /><li>We are curious and have a culture of continuous improvement so we are always keen to learn more and improve ourselves and Pragmateam.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>To be successful in the role you&rsquo;ll have the following skills:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Extensive commercial experience (usually 6+ years) in developing custom built web applications, ideally having worked with JavaScript and some of the usual (or unusual) Javascript frameworks such as React, Angular, VueJS or Node.js.</li><br /><li>Solid experience working in teams that use XP practices (eg. CI, TDD, pairing, small releases).</li><br /><li>Support and coach others as well as help teams improve and develop their capabilities, through pairing, Coding Dojos, Dev Guilds, Brown Bags, mentoring, influencing, 1-on-1's etc.</li><br /><li>Experience across the full tech stack with an interest in developing software both backend and front end (a bias to one side is normal and totally fine).</li><br /><li>Experience with TDD and the benefits of writing tests first before starting on your code.</li><br /><li>Solid experience refactoring code, ability to describe different refactoring techniques.</li><br /><li>Experience with Object Oriented programming and able to discuss design patterns.</li><br /><li>Passion for writing Clean Code, so everyone in the team can understand it.</li><br /><li>Awareness of distributed architectures and micro-services and interest to learn more.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Our Recruitment Process</strong></p><br /><ol><br /><li>Phone interview (30-60 minutes)</li><br /><li>Test Coverage exercise (2-3 hours)</li><br /><li>Pairing + Tech Interview (60-90 minutes)</li><br /><li>Management Interview (60 minutes)</li><br /></ol><br /><p><strong>Interested? </strong>Apply below or you take a look further at Pragmateam here: <a href=\"https://pragma.team/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pragma.team/</a></p>",

You're not the type of engineer who wants a fully-fleshed out spec thrown over the wall for you to code.\n* Pragmatic: Let's say you have a tradeoff to make: Option A is to ship something fast using an off-the-shelf API on AWS; you won't learn that much and it only solves 80% of the problem, but it'll only take a few days. Option B is to invest about two weeks building a new library and internally-hosted service that perfectly solves the problem; as a bonus you can share it on Github and give a presentation about it at PyCon. If you choose Option A 10/10 then you'll be at home here.\n* Specific languages: We don't really care if you've worked in our stack before as long as you're happy to learn it. If you're sharp enough to be on this team, you're sharp enough to learn any language or framework quickly.\n\n**Our stack**\n\n* Python 3\n* Django\n* Postgres\n* Heroku (with full CI pipeline)\n* Redis / Celery\n* Kafka\n\n**Compensation**\n\n* At least $150,000/year\n* We believe in paying top-of-market to attract the best person for each role.\n* However, the compensation package is usually the second reason people choose to join a startup. The primary reason is they want to experience the growth that comes from pouring your heart and soul into building something that people love. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we do.\n\n**Things to consider**\n\nThis won't be easy. We work extremely hard to sustain our execution velocity and have sky-high expectations of each other. This fact is itself a huge reward: getting to work with other individuals as stellar as you.\n\n**Benefits**\n\n* Paid Time Off\n* Health Insurance\n* 401k / HSA / FSA\n\n**We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to meet you!**",

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around since 1991, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going strong.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.\n\nSince we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.\n\nWe work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.\n\nArt+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.\n\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example of some projects we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:\n\n* Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login\n* Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)\n* Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display\n\n**What we want from you: (aka: skills)**\n\nWe currently have a high demand for Python (specifically Django), JavaScript web framework experience (specifically Vue.js), and those with macOS and iOs experience.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nHowever, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.\n\n**Relationship Details:**\n\nWe are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $40-$60/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.\n\nWe want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.\u00c2\u00a0",

      "description": "**Software Engineer - Integrations**\n\n**About Us**\n\nEtleap came to be out of the frustration with how much time data wrangling takes away from the actual analysis. We were just tired of spending time building and maintaining data pipelines. Then we noticed, so is everyone else! That is why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created an intuitive ETL tool that easily enables the data analysts themselves to integrate data from any source. This way data analysts can do their most significant work faster than ever before.\n\nNow we are looking to add engineers to our core engineering team to help build the infrastructure and the integrations that modern data teams depend on to create and operate their data warehouse! It shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take a CS degree to use big data effectively, and abstracting away the difficult parts is our mission.\n\nAre you ready for the challenge?\n\n**What you are going to do:**\n* Be part of the team that is building the next generation of ETL software\n* Build fast, scalable, easy-to-maintain integrations that gets data flowing with minimal latency\n* Come up with novel ideas on how to extend Etleap\u00e2\u0080\u0099s integrations framework, and then implement those ideas as reusable interfaces and components\n\n**What we want to see in you:**\n* You love data engineering\n* You write robust and maintainable code three times as fast as other developers\n* You find reverse-engineering systems interesting\n* Coding in Java is second nature to you\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to work in a scrappy, fast-paced environment\n* You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re down to earth and fun to work with.

      "description": "Hello there \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008b\n\nThanks for being interested in Deedmob!\n\nI'm David, one of the founders of Deedmob &amp; CTO and who will be reviewing your application if you choose to apply \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082 . Let's get it straight out of the way: you would be Engineer #3 in a team of 6. Below you'll find detailed sections on what we think you should know about us before deciding to join us. Feel to skip to sections which interest you!\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u00a7\u00b3  The story of Deedmob so far\n\nMy cofounder Boudewijn and I started Deedmob 4 years ago in Amsterdam to help connect young people with purpose in their careers, and help solve large social problems in the process. We set out to build a platform that would help charities engage our generation with flexible, impactful and enjoyable volunteering opportunities. \n\nWe've taken lots of twists and turns along the way, we've learned a bunch and helped thousands of organizations spur volunteers into action. We have a small and effective team and believe in working smarter, not harder. We've discovered it's incredible how much a small team of focused and capable individuals can accomplish through effective teamwork and communication. We don't have many meetings, and most of our work happens asynchronously (written) on Asana. Everyone is included and can see every discussion or decision they want to contribute to. \n\nSometimes working at startups can be stressful and you can be expected to work unpaid overtime or on the weekends. That is not the case here at deedmob. You have the choice to work 4 days a week and work rarely extends beyond working hours.\n\nDuring the coronavirus crisis we shifted our work onto creating coronahelpers, a multi country volunteering initiative which helped thousands of at risk or ill people receive critical goods such as medicine and groceries. Our work resulted in mentions of deedmob and coronahelpers in dutch parliament, a conversation with the dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and the dutch queen Maxima. We were also honoured this year on Forbes' 30 under 30 social entrepreneurs list alongside Greta Thunberg.\n\nWe are growing steadily and in the past we have raised money from venture capital investors. We are now focused on growing a stable, impactful and profitable social enterprise without additional external investment.\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009d  The product\n\nWe have a stable customer base of large companies like TomTom, Red Bull and H&amp;M which use our software for corporate volunteering. The same product is also used by charities and local governments to engage people to volunteer. Our business model is SaaS (Software as a service) which means we charge customers per month to use our hosted solution. Our customers include Sanquin, the national dutch blood bank, large companies and local governments like Utrecht. Charities can use our platform to find volunteers for free, which is what you can see at deedmob.com. \n\nOur paid product allows organizations to create their own website with an inbuilt CRM, analytics and administrative data views into the platform. You can learn more about it at deedmobtools.com. Our product is one product with options to configure theme, pages and other settings per customer. \n\nWe try to be pragmatic about product management and we've learned our fair share. We were once a feature factory (See [https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory)) but have learned our lesson since. We have a set of standard components we use to make interfaces and don't use a product designer for interface work, instead relying on our premade systems and the strengths of interface intuition of our team. A great resource for developing this skill is Refactoring UI ([https://refactoringui.com/](https://refactoringui.com/)). This lets us get stuff done faster and with fewer people who need to understand the problem and solution. This comes with tradeoffs, and sometimes we do spend a longer time thinking about a particular problem from a product design perspective. \n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00bb  What kind of technical work do we have upcoming?\n\n- 30% Making small adjustments to features or interface to make our product clearer or solve the customer's problems better, based on their feedback. Often it's little product changes that can add lots of value to customers. This often involves learning more about the customer's problem and clarifying their feedback with the product manager in order to come up with the best and simplest solution.\n- 20% Working on a new larger feature based on a customer problem we see across customers that is the biggest pain point. An example of such work on our roadmap is a file manager for the different files uploaded by an organisation in our tool.\n- 20% Fixing bugs. We have automated integration tests but sometimes there are visual issues or uncovered parts of the codebase where something goes wrong. We don't support IE or most annoying older browsers that would otherwise cause time consuming bugs.\n- 20% Adding a feature required for the launch of a new customer. This is almost always something that will also be useful for our existing customer base, but would have been a dealbreaker for this customer.\n- 10% DevOps/Deployments/Tech debt elimination\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080  About the role starts here\n\n**We think an ideal candidate would**\n\n- have the ability to ship solid code in React and Node (and Typescript, but you can learn that on the job)\n- understand how web apps work and have a basic understanding of deployments, browsers, servers etc.\n- acknowledge the challenges working in teams and believe that empathetic and effective communication is important\n- have an attitude of humbleness towards technology and the risks of creating problems from trying to solve problems too early (such as scaling, performance)\n- have a preference towards the simplest solution rather than the most technically interesting or most theoretically correct one\n- have pragmatism in being able to make decisions with incomplete information, and knowing when it's best to ask for clarification\n- have good personal time management skills\n- have good english communication skills\n- be able to help contribute to UI decisions for new features\n- have an attitude of learning and growth\n- be experienced with the challenges of remote work\n- have a feeling of responsibility for upholding product stability and quality\n- be empathetic and develop an understanding of our customer's problems\n\n**After the first 6 months we expect you to**\n\n- have shipped tasks making product roadmap progress and added value to customers\n- have helped upheld current technical stability and uptime\n- be communicating effectively in the team\n- be leading engineering decisions\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u00be  About the codebase starts here\n\nWe started work on deedmob in 2016 with React + Redux + Node + REST + Postgres and Server side rendering. In 2019 we converted the entire codebase to Typescript as well as React functional components and hooks. In early 2020 we also added GraphQL for some endpoints.\n\nHere are some points about how we do things currently\n\n- We deploy to google cloud via Kubernetes &amp; using cloud build so that one command can release a new version of the codebase.\n- We use github for git hosting.\n- We release approximately once every one to two weeks without a fixed schedule\n- We have automated integration tests in cypress for all important product flows.\n- We share lots of types and files between the frontend and the backend, as its all typescript!\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u008f\u009d  About remote work at deedmob\n\nWe have experimented with a couple days remote for the last couple of years but more recently during the coronavirus crisis we gave up our beautiful office in Amsterdam in favour of full remote work.\n\nWe have regular retreats to bring the team together in an epic location, and have had great times travelling together to Marrakech Morocco, Albufeira Portugal and Lisbon.\n\nThe role is remote but we are currently open to candidates within 2 hours of our timezone (CET) in order to reduce any possible issues with meeting times and occasional synchronous collaboration.\n\nWe have daily standups in morning and work without a specific methodology (like agile) currently as we have tried it and found it's not useful at our small team size.\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0093 The interview process, roughly\n\n- 20 min call to assess fit \n- 40 minute live react coding call (no algorithms testing)\n- 3hr take home assignment\n- 30 minute technical call to discuss assignment submission with two engineers\n- 30 minute product call\n- 30 minute call with ceo\noffer\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0080  About some of the people of deedmob\n\nBoudewijn Wijnands (CEO): A closer of deals. A fan of disney and dogs. Can always be bribed with chocolate or cake. [https://www.linkedin.com/in/boudewijnwijnands/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boudewijnwijnands/)\n\nDavid (CTO): It feels weird to write about myself here in the third person.

Recently started as a part time working student.\n\n>>>>>> \u00f0\u009f\u008e\u0081  Perks\n\n**Here are some of the perks of the job**\n\n- Impactful, purpose driven work (for instance our software has activated 20,000 new blood donors in the last 2 years)\n- Computer setup of your choice\n- Option for 4 days a week\n- Responsibility &amp; the accompanying freedom and learning\n- Work from home (or from a co-working space)\n- Regular team retreats to sunny and fun locations\n- Core contribution into what we work on and how we solve a problem\n- Volunteering time off work\n- Low amount of time spent in meetings\n- Yearly budget for learning and development\n- Financial stability of the company (job security)\n- Low stress environment (low frequency of urgent issues or work)\n- Sizable equity compensation\n- Market rate salary compensation\n\nWe think it's an incredible and rare opportunity for the right person. However we also know that there are great engineers like you that would be unhappy and not thrive in this role.\n\nIn the interest of transparency and avoiding a mismatch, **we think you should consider these reasons not to join us.**\n\n- There are fewer senior people to learn from and ask questions to than at a bigger company. Learning and career development is important to us but it will largely have to be self motivated and with external mentors or on the internet. We want to help you achieve your personal goals and will support you financially and structurally to achieve them.\n- We're growing, but the company is not growing in value or team size as fast as hyper funded startups. If you're hoping to get rich quick by joining a startup very early we would recommend choosing somewhere else.\n- If you need structure and someone to tell you what to work on, you will probably struggle with the autonomy and freedom you will have at Deedmob. A bigger company is probably a better choice.\n- If you want to work on a new project every couple of weeks, it's probably not a good fit. While the work is varied and changes, lots of the work is making improvements to our core product which some people don't like doing as much. That's fine. We know that building something great takes time and many of the greatest breakthroughs are small changes based on deep insights. We share less exciting work equally and try to reduce it by investing in changes or automating things. That being said, if you're easily bored and want constant new technical challenges it may not be the best role for you. Many of our challenges are product and technical challenges, so someone interested in being involved heavily in adding value to our customers through gaining a deeper problem understanding will thrive.\n- You should not join us if you want to work 60 hour weeks. We've been there when we started out. We firmly believe it's not about how hard you work, but how good your decisions are about what to work on and how. Some people really like working all day. We'd rather finish at 5 and spend time with our families or significant others.\n- If you think more features and complex technology is the best way to solve all problems, we probably have a different philosophy and it won't be a good fit. Technology is great and we strive to make great, pragmatic decisions but we see it as a means to solve customer problems. For us the most valuable work at the moment is usually creating great and often simple solutions learned from a deep product understanding rather than improving performance.\n- There's lots of code in our codebase that other people have written, and while there are docs, comments and we have eliminated technical debt on a rolling basis, understanding other's people code can be time consuming and not feel productive. We understand working on a new codebase can be more fun and more varied, and if that's very important to you, you probably shouldn't join us. We expect it will take you some time to learn how things work and we will support you in that process, but if in the past you find yourself wanting to work on something new and novel after 6 months we would recommend you to look for somewhere else.\n\n>>>>>> \u00e2\u008f\u00ac  TLDR;\n\nWe're an awesome small team who have work-life balance and a purpose driven product.",

      "description": "At Nedap, we strongly believe that we can empower people with technology. This means that we put people first and technology second. Our software solutions therefore not only facilitate administrative personnel processes. They stimulate professionals to make better use of the talents and potential of their employees. We strive for transparent communication, and for more influence, overview and involvement of flex workers and employees.\n\nThe basis of our codebase is three Ruby applications. We use Clojure for a number of supporting shared services. We increasingly notice that, based on user demand, there is a need to increase the coherence of functionalities, to offer the applications as one, and to place the mobile development on an equal footing with the web applications. Therefore, a slow shift is taking place in which GraphQL APIs are being built to serve React and React Native frontends. However, much of the business logic still remains in the Ruby applications, which are also being extended. We would like to add a Ruby Developer to our (remote) team to spar with and accelerate development.\n\n\n## Your team\n\nAs a Ruby Developer (remote), you are part of a close team and as a team you are responsible for our time registration and roster applications. You will study the domain and the applications, decide together with the team what the most added value is for the product and determine how it will be implemented and when it will be finished. This gives you a lot of freedom to determine what you put your energy into, but it also means that you have to be able to explain why you make a choice and why it will help us. You combine the creation of new features with the implementation of structural technical improvements.\n\nAt Nedap, we find it important that you learn from each other. You aim to achieve the best results as a team. That is why you have constructive discussions with your team about the pros and cons of various technical solutions. You are not afraid to ask questions and not too proud to change your point of view. You do not hesitate to give or receive feedback and you enjoy helping others along the way.\n\n\n## Our offer\n\nYou get a challenging position in a dynamic and international business. A job where you work together with peers using the newest techniques and where you get the full opportunity to develop yourself. At Nedap, you have the freedom to organize and shape your job in such a way that you can really make the difference and live up to your potential.\n\n\n## Required experience and skills\n\nYou recognize yourself in the following:\n* You have at least one year of experience with Ruby and other object-oriented programming languages;\n* You have a strong sense of responsibility;\n* You love diversity and disagreement, and are not afraid to ask questions;\n* Experience with Docker and distributed systems is a plus.",

      "description": "At Cogsy, we're creating simple yet powerful action-taking tools that promote operational excellence for DTC brands.\n\nWe're a smart and calm, fully remote team that's passionate about making a lasting impact on the future of retail operations. We're energized by creating a team culture where each individual brings their full self to work each day.\n\nWe're looking for an experienced Content & Community Marketer to help us shape marketing content that'll be of lasting value for our customers. If you were to join Cogsy today, you'd have a great impact on our marketing strategy and a great influence over our product\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth.\n\nYou're likely a good fit for this position if you:\n* Are energized by our values.\n* Are a true content creator and can make progress both independently and within a team.\n* Have hands-on experience creating a good amount of written and video content.\n* Are passionate about the latest DTC trends and building relationships within that online community.\n* Take action and pay attention to detail.\n* Have superior communication skills.\n* Are self-motivated and feel comfortable working effectively in a 100% remote environment.\n* Confident when it comes to taking risks, trying new things, and learning from failure.\n* Have full-time availability and want to be a key player on our team for the long-haul.\n\n## Requirements\nYou will be responsible for creating content that drives traffic to the Cogsy website, helping us grow from a handful of customers to hundreds (and then thousands) of happy customers.\n\nWhen you join our marketing team, you will:\n* Deeply understand our customer base to create the best content to showcase how our product can help their business.\n* Distill technical information into simple, clear copy for articles, e-books, YouTube video scripts, social media posts, ads, website landing pages, and more.\n* Connect with members of the DTC community to grow our audience and reach.\n* Create in-depth, heavily researched articles to attract DTC brands whether their yearly revenue is $250k or $25m.\n* Develop, produce and publish editorial video content that aligns with Cogsy's overarching social strategy\n* Be the steward of Cogsy's voice and identity across relevant video-based platforms\n* Independently conduct SEO research with Clearscope and ahrefs for every article and incorporate it into your final product.\n* Keep up-to-date about the latest research and happenings in the DTC space.\n* Be comfortable with change. Your day-to-day responsibilities will look different depending on current projects, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re okay with variability.\n* Organizational prowess. You know how to build a project in a PM tool, track things meticulously, and keep the team informed on progress.\n\nOur marketing team works to ensure that every piece of content we publish is accessible and helpful to DTC brands. We're helping them reach operational excellence and improving their bottom lines. Their success is our success.\n\nIt's important to us that the person we hire can thrive and be successful in this role. Reflecting on your past experiences, you have:\n* crafted product-related blog posts, videos, guides, and more with benefit-driven, compelling storylines.\n* created quality relationships with members of the DTC community.\n* edited with a hawk-eye for even the smallest, most minuscule details.\n* produced memorable video content to educate and attract customers.\n* educated different types of team members about brand style guides, adjusting your communication style to your audience.\n* empathized strongly with users, channeling it into the various types of content that you write, both long- and short-form.\n* used information from user research, SEO, traffic analytics, email analytics, marketing data dashboards, and more to inform future copy decisions.\n\nThis is a remote position and you can work from wherever. It is however important that we maintain connectedness as a team and have sufficient time for synchronous work too. We'd prefer team members that are on EST (or +- 2 hour difference) or work on those schedules, as that means that there is 3-4 hours overlap for the whole team every day.\n\n## Benefits\n* True flexible work: Work whenever and wherever your work best, taking into account some overlap time every day to stay aligned as a team.\n* Trust-based autonomy. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the expert in your domain. We trust you to solve challenges the way you feel is best. Count on the rest of the team to support you when you need, but never micromanage you.\n* Diverse team: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be working with a diverse team from a range of countries and backgrounds. Making Cogsy an inclusive workplace is a top priority.\n* We are a life- and family-first company that seeks meaningful experiences outside of work and we endeavor to help our customers do the same.\n* Monthly learning and wellness allowance. Buy books, pay for your yoga class or get a Calm subscription for greater mindfulness. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover whatever helps you develop as an individual and become the best you.\n* Paid for retreats: Once global travel is open again, we'll do week-long team retreats in fun locations.\n* Flexible holiday policy: Take time off whenever you need to recharge or attend to other matters. The team will hold you accountable to taking a minimum amount of time off in any rolling 12-month window.\n* Parental leave for those individuals that plan to discover the joys of having (more) children.\n* Health insurance (powered by Safety Wing) tailored for remote team members, whether you're at home, traveling or being a nomad.\n\nDoes this sound like you? Want to be part of a self-motivated, empathetic, nimble team working to build something big? If that sounds like something you want to be part of, we want to hear from you.\n",
